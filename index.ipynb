On the loudspeaker the incoming variable intensity electricity causes the faces to attract or repel each other.\n",

Before recording the signal, a Dolby NR system (Noise Reduction) on the tape proceeds to amplify the low amplitudes and attenuate the high amplitudes, following a logarithmic scale (this is what is known as a audio (analog) compressor). After reading the distorted signal of the tape, it is necessary to attenuate (using an audio expander) the low amplitudes and to amplify the high ones, obtaining the original signal. Since the noise is of low amplitude, the expander attenuates it. The effect is a reproduction of greater fidelity.\n",

At that time, stereo systems were only used in movie theaters and Dolby had the happy idea of creating two more virtual channels called central ($C$) and surround or surround ($S$).\n",
