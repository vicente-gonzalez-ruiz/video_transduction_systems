    "* Historians say that the telescope was invented by the Dutch optician Hans Lippershey in the early seventeenth century. However, the first astronomical discoveries (such as the observation of the phases of Venus or the main moons of Jupiter) were carried out by the Italian physicist and astronomer Galileo Galiei. Thanks to his observations he discovered that the Earth revolved around the Sun, and not the other way around, as the Church maintained, and for that reason he was condemned to life imprisonment.\n",

In this way, objects can be observed that, due to their distance, bring to us a quantity of luminous radiation that can not be perceived by the naked eye."
